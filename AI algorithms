#Responsible AI algorithms
1 Transparency - 
Explainability : make AI algorithms more understandable and interpretable by providing explanations for their decisions and actions.
Openness : share information about the design, functioning, and outcomes of AI algorithms with relevant stakeholders, subject to privacy and security constraints.

2 Accountability - 
Responsibility assignment : clearly define and assign responsibilities for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI algorithms.
Redress mechanisms : implement mechanisms for addressing and correcting errors or harm caused by AI algorithms, including channels for affected individuals to seek redress.

3 Privacy - 
Data protection : design AI algorithms with privacy-preserving features to protect sensitive information.
Informed consent : obtain informed consent when collecting and using personal data for AI Purposes.

4 Security - 
Secure design : prioritize the security of AI algorithms to prevent vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
Regular updates : keep algorithms up to date with security patches to address emerging threats.

5 Human-in-the-loop - 
Human oversight : include human oversight in decision-making processes, especially in critical contexts.
Human Augmentation : Design AI algorithms to enhance human capabilities rather than replace human decision-makers entirely.
